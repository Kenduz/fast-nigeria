            <p>Your computer comes preloaded with a number of applications that many people won’t use but that can eat
                up system resources. You can usually identify these when you see a pop-up prompting you to update a
                program you’ve never used before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or, you can right-click on Start and visit Programs and Features. Windows assistant Cortana can also be
                helpful because it can perform a search for “Programs” in its search box. From there, you’ll find a
                record of which apps you’ve used recently and which take up the most space. After surveying what’s
                installed, you can decide which programs can be deleted to help improve system performance.

            <p>Many physical factors can result in slow LTE or 5G. These include weather, network congestion, and even
                solar activity. But chief among these are geography and buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're in a remote area, or there are a lot of natural barriers around you (such as hills, mountains,
                and valleys), you'll probably experience a poor signal. Try to move to a more even-leveled location if
                the landscape around you fits one of these extremes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same goes for being inside buildings. You might be in the middle of a heavily populated urban area
                with full bars on your device, then wonder why your data becomes so slow when you enter certain
                structures. Being underground, or surrounded by concrete in a structure like a basement, can negatively
                affect your data signal.
